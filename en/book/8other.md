# 8.0 Miscellaneous Notes



When the MyLinks module is being viewed there are two sublinks accessible in the main menu:

**Top Rated sublink**

This displays a list of the top 10 links in each category as ranked by users (see ‘Rate this site’ above). The average rating and number of hits and votes is also displayed.

**Popular**

As above, except that it displays the top 10 links according to the number of hits.

**Other notes - managing notifications**

Members can view and edit their notification subscriptions through the ‘Notifications’ link in the User Menu. This displays a list of a member’s currently active notifications and allows them to be deleted.
